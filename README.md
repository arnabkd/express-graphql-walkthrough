# GraphQL example

## Prerequisites
Install the following before starting
```
brew install yarn

npm install eslint -g
npm install nodemon
```

## Start the server
```
nodemon server.js
```

This should start a graphql server at `http://localhost:4000/graphql`.
Copy/pasting this into your browser should show you the graphiql IDE.
